# Unit 18 PWA Homework: Online/Offline Budget Trackers

# Description
This is a working budget tracker application that I have been tasked with converting into a PWA (Progressive Web Application).

## Usage
The user can use the app to track their spendings and earnings to they can better save their money.

a way to see the app as a PWA is to first navigate to the app in chrome on a mobile device then hit the 3 dots in the top right corner and select "Add to Home Screen" this will make the website into its own application on your mobile devices home screen.
